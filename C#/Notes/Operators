OPERATORS

++x = do the operaters on the vaue of x and when the program steps down then increment 1 to value of x
x++ = take he value of x and increment it by one, then do the operation neccesary on the value

 x & y - TRUE IF X AND Y TRUE
 x | y - TRUE IF EITHER X OR Y TRUE
 x ^ y - TRUE IF ONE IS TRUE AND OTHER IS FALSE (EXCLUSIVE OR)
 
 x && y 
        -- short circuit (if one value doesn't meet criteria then the system doesn't bother checking the other side of statement)
 x || y 
 
 
 0101
 0001
 0001 = 5 & 1 = 1
 
 0101
 0001
 0101 = 5 | 1 = 5
 
 0101
 0001
 0100 = 5 ^ 1 = 4
 
 
 ~x bitwise complement (unray) - reverses each bit of x
 
 
 x << y left shift - Shifts bits of x to the left by y positions
 9 << 3 = 00001001 to 0100100(72)
 
 x >> y - Shifts bits of x to the right by y positions
 9 >> 2 = 00001001 to 00000010 (2)
 
 > - comparison opperator
 
 --Tuples
 | allows you to return two variables
 | passing out a reference to where the values are stored rather than passing out the values
 
 --Method Overloading
 | Mehod overloading refers to having more than one method with the same name but different parameter lists
 
 
 ARRAYS & STRINGS
 --Array: A way to store a list of data of the same type
 | an array can be accessed by an index
 | can decleare and initialize an array at the same time
 | Arrays can be two or more dimensions (Multidimensional Array)
 
 
 
 new = instanciating a new object
 
 
 --String 
 - parsing is a way we can use and check ifferent types of string input
 
 
 :p(n) - percentage
 
 
 -DoWhile - Will deffinelty execute once and then till the condition is no longer met
