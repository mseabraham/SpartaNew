Basic concepts of programming languages(variables, types, statements, conditions, loops, functions, arrays, objects, inheritance)
Some variation in syntax but the main differences are how they behave "under the hood" 

--NAMING CONVENTION
Pascal Case: First letter (Namespace)
CamelCase: humped method naming (nameSpace)
Snake


DLL - compiled linkable files
EXE - executable file

--HOW TO BUILD FROM THE COMMAND LINE
dotnet new console --new console application
dotnet new web -n DemoWebApp --
dotnet new wpf -n DemoWPFApp
dotnet new mvc -n DemoMVCApp


----VARIABLES----
- Varaible - storage of memory where you save a value
- Variables have a name, type and stors a value (int age = 23)
- Must start with a letter or underscore
- Choose meaningful names

----DATA TYPES----
- Every type has a defined (size; how much space needed to store data, Allowed operations/methods)
- Most value types are simple/primitive
- structs and enums are usually comp;ex
- Reference types are usually complex

- Statically typed: defined at compile time
- Type safe: prevents values of one type being substituted for another, incompatible type
- Memory safe: Prevents access to invalid memory


- Impliciant Casting - not defining that you are casting but allowin the system to do it for you
- Explicit casting - e.g. float example = (float) 2;


Strongly typed langauge - must define the type of a variable before and can only change it through explicit casting
Weakly typed language - the type can changeduring the lifespan of the program
